# Introduction
In this project, we have to analyze a dataset and then communicate our findings about it. We will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.

I have used TMDb movie Dataset that contains about 10,000 movies collected from The Movies Database(TMDb). The goal of this investigation is to analyze insights about movie features to help movie industry to earn more profits.

### What do I need to install?
You will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:(pandas,NumPy,Matplotlib,csv) It will be recommend to installing Anaconda, which comes with all of the necessary packages, as well as jupyter notebook.

### Why this Project?
We were given Three different datasets to pick one. As a movie lover I just got attracted to this one naturally. Answering the questions for analysis provided me with a personal satisfaction as they were have had me curious for a long time.

### Questions for analysis.
> Which movie genres and actors are more popular?
> Which movie genre is more profitable to produce?
> What properties are associated with movies wiyh high revenue?
> Does a movie's popularity influence its profit?

### What I have learnt?

After completing the project, I have;
> mastered all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process 
> Become comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
> understood how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
> Practiced communicating the results of analysis
> Been able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
> Enjoyed using Matplotlib to explore data and produce plots showing findings
